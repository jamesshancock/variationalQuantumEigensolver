# variationalQuantumEigensolver
Classical and Quantum code for the VQE

A collection of python scripts to compute eigenvalues using the VQE method
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variational_quantum_eigensolver)

##  How to run teh scripts

Run the script create_matrix.py to create the matrix and store it
in a file such as H_store_A.npy.

The following scripts compute the eigenvalues using different
techniques.
